# Assignment 2 JavaScript

## Question 1

I have created a web app called Train the Tractors where you have to decide whether the tractors have created a real word or not. I used my sons interest in tractors as the theme for this app so that he can enjoy playing it.

My web app code can be found in the files in this folder. My HTML is in the index.html file, my CSS is in the styles.css file and my JavaScript is in the code.js file. The images for the tractor icons are stored in the images folder.

## Question 2

My answers to question 2 can be found in question2.md
