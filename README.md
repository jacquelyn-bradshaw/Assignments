# CFGDegree-assignments

A GitHub repository to store my CFG Degree assignments.

In this readme you will find the descriptions and screenshots I have created for Assignment 1.

For the past 5 years I have been on a career break to look after my children. This has always been my ambition to create a long lasting relationship with them whilst they are young. My son loves :tractor: and my daughter loves :fairy:.

During that time I have had the opportunity to learn how to switch careers and what I am best suited at. I have spent the past 15 months in the evenings learning :student: how to code including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- React

I have learnt the basics of other languages but I always come back to JavaScript. I have used CFG MOOCs and KickStarters alongside Udemy to learn. My husband is very supportive of my learning journey and this CFG Degree.

I previously created a GitHub Profile readme which can be found **[here](https://github.com/jacquelyn-bradshaw)**.

Previous repositories I have created can be found **[here](https://github.com/jacquelyn-bradshaw?tab=repositories)**.

### Checking the status

To check the status you run the command `git status`

Here is a screenshot of this command in use:

### Creating a branch

To create a branch named development you run the command `git branch development`

Here is a screenshot showing use of the commands for creating a branch, listing your branches and switching branch.

### Adding files to a branch

### .gitignore

.gitignore is a file that can be added to the root directory of your repository. It stops files or folders you have added to the .gitignore file from being committed to your repository. I have created a ignore_me folder and added it to my .gitignore file so that it is not committed. I have previously used .gitignore files to ensure that node modules are not committed.

### requirements.txt

A file that contains all the libraries or packages your code depends on. You create a list of packages or libraries. You can use == and then specify a version for that package or library **e.g. package/library_name == version**. To install the packages or libraries in the requirements.txt file you use the command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
